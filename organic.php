        <p>
It is important to monitor the quality of the agriculture input to
 quality control of them and making necessary recommendation and to
 ensure the existence of environmental quality in the agriculture sector.

pH, electrical conductivity, moisture, organic carbon, total nitrogen,
 total phosphorous,   total potassium and sand are analyzing in compost 
 analysis and reports will be submitted.</p> </div>
        <div class="about2"><h2>Soil Sample Analysis</h2>
<p>Excessive use of fertilizer course unnecessary nutrient retention in the soil is major problem in
 future crops production and develop the nutrient imbalances in the soil. Therefore application of 
 soil test based fertilizer recommendation is more sensible nutrient management plan for the application
of correct source and correct amount of fertilizer application and reduce the indiscriminate use of fertilizer
and environmental contamination. In addition advices are given to correct the pH in the soil. Therefore fertilizer
 use efficiency also increased.  

In soil analysis pH, Electrical conductivity, available, phosphorous, exchangeable potassium and
 organic matters are determined.</p></div>
        <div class="about3"><h3>Trace Elemental analysis including Heavy Metals</h3><br>
 <p>The laboratory is capable of analyze and report the 14 elements including arsenic (As),
 cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg) presence in food and water. The analysis is done by
  inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Safety of the food is determined by the
   maximum permissible limits published by the FAO / WHO.</p></div>

<p>Analyzes and report on pesticide residues in food and water.
 The laboratory is equipped with advanced technical equipment such as LC/MS/MS, GC/MS, and GC-ECD.
  The internationally accepted QuEChERS methodology is used to perform the extraction and 
  clean up with the method validation according to the SANTE/12682/2019 guideline. The Health Safety of Foods Analyzed by MRL's 
(Maximum Residue Limits) is determined by the Government Gazette Extraordinary No. 2023/34 dated 14.06.2017.</p></div>
        <div class="about2"><h2>Pesticide Analysis</h2><br>
<p>The laboratory is equipped with equipment such as GC-ECD/NPD/FID, HPLC, FTIR, UV spectroscopy,
and Karl Fisher Titrator. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of pesticide formulations and
reporting of heavy metals in pesticides as impurities.Contributes to the quality assurance officerpage
the pesticide formulations imported into the country.</p></div>
        <div class="about3"><h2>Saline agriculture</h2><p>
People have long believed that salt-affected land was unusable. But as a result of in-depth
 research and years of testing, a practical solution was found: Saline agriculture.
It is very well possible to grow crops on salt-affected land, as long as the right (salt tolerant) 
crops are being used, combined with alternative techniques in irrigation, fertilization and water management. 
With saline agriculture, food is produced on salt-affected soils and salt or brackish water is used for irrigation.</p>
